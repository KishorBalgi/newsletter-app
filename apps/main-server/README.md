<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The newsletter application is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the creation, management, and distribution of newsletters and articles. Leveraging modern technologies and best practices, this project offers a robust and scalable solution for publishers and subscribers alike.

#### Key Features

- **CRUD Operations:** The Node.js main server handles all CRUD operations, including authentication, newsletter management, and article creation.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure access to protected resources is ensured through _JSON Web Token (JWT)_ authentication.
- **Redis Cache:** Utilizing _Redis_ as a caching layer optimizes performance by storing frequently accessed data such as newsletters and articles.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** _RabbitMQ_ facilitates asynchronous communication between components, enabling decoupled and scalable architecture.
- **Email Notification:** Subscribers receive timely email notifications whenever new articles are published, with the help of a dedicated _email server_ and _Nodemailer_ integration.
- **Relational Database:** Data is stored in _PostgreSQL_, offering reliability, consistency, and powerful querying capabilities through _Prisma ORM_.
- **Dockerization:** _Docker_ containers ensure easy deployment and scalability across different environments, promoting consistency and reliability.
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** The frontend is built using _Next.js_ for server-side rendering, _Tailwind CSS_ for styling, and _Shadcn/ui_ for UI components, providing a seamless user experience.

#### Architecture

- **Article Creation**:

  - Authors use the application's interface to create new articles. This process likely involves filling out a form.
  - Upon submission, the article data is sent to the Node.js main server.

- **Data Persistence**:

  - The Node.js server receives the article data and interacts with the PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM to persist the article information.
  - The article's details, including its title, content, author information, publication date, and any associated metadata, are stored securely in the database.

- **Cache Update**:

  - The Node.js server also updates the Redis cache with the newly created newsletter's and article's information. This step helps optimize read performance for frequently accessed articles.

- **Event Publishing**:

  - After successfully storing the article in the database, the Node.js server publishes a message to the RabbitMQ server. This message contains information about the newly published article, such as its unique identifier or a reference to its database record.
  - RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous communication and decouples the article publishing process from the subsequent notification of subscribers.

- **Subscriber Notification**:

  - A separate server, dedicated to handling email notifications, consumes messages from the RabbitMQ queue. This server will be running in the background, continuously checking for new messages.
  - Upon receiving a message indicating that a new article has been published, the email server retrieves the article details from the database, and the subscribers' information from the of the newsletter.
  - The email server then crafts personalized email notifications addressed to each subscriber of the relevant newsletter and sends them out using Nodemailer and the Gmail SMTP service.
  - The email server then sends out these notifications, informing subscribers about the newly published article and providing links or excerpts to encourage engagement.

- **Email Delivery**:

  - Gmail's SMTP service handles the delivery of email notifications to subscribers' inboxes. This ensures reliable and timely delivery of updates.
  - Subscribers receive the email notifications and can click on the provided links to read the full articles directly on the application's website.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Subscribers can access the articles via the links provided in the email notifications or by visiting the application's frontend interface directly.
  - The frontend, built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui, provides a user-friendly experience for browsing and reading articles. Subscribers can navigate through the list of available newsletters, view articles, and interact with various UI components.

#### Project Goal

This project serves as an exploration of modern web development practices, tools, and technologies. By implementing a newsletter platform, the aim is to showcase the end-to-end process of building a full-stack application, from database design and server-side logic to frontend development and user interface design.

The project's architecture emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and performance, with a focus on decoupling components and leveraging asynchronous communication patterns. By incorporating industry-standard tools and libraries.
